# CaffeeCraft-testing


Use:

- `gradle build` to build the project
- `gradle run` to run the project


# TODO:
- Use interceptor for the token, and save token globally (or safe palce/secrets?)
- Maybe return coffeeType instead of String in recommendCoffee
- Maybe remove SugarLevel and MoodLevel enum, and use ints instead.
